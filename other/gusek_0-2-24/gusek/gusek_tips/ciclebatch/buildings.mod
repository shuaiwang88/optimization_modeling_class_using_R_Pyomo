# Problem posed by Nicolas, original model by Xypron, adapted by Luiz Bettoni
#
# Suppose we have a squared-grid (size=n) with n2 cells with a 4-connexity
# neighborhood. Each cell must contains exactly one building. We have several
# building colors (blue, red and green, etc) with an increasing amount of points.
#
# The game rules are the following:
# * No constraints on blue buildings.
# * Red buildings must have at least one blue building in its neighborhood.
# * Green buildings must have at least one red building and at least one blue
#    building in its neighborhood.
# * etc...
#
# The goal is to maximize the number of points by having the biggest buildings
# (blue < red < green < ...).
